LeapSnippets
============

This is a collection of little python apps written for the [Leap](https://leapmotion.com/).

# LeapSample

A sample app from Leap Motion which prints out hand and finger information on the console.

# LeapClick

An app that detects a click like finger move (increased y-axis velocity downwards).

# LeapClick_sound

This app incorporates the same algorithm as above but plays a sound if the click was performed.

# LeapClick_midi

Same as above, but plays a MIDI note instead of a sound file.

# LeapMouseHorizontal

Controls the mouse like a normal mouse: on a horizontal plane above the Leap.

# LeapMouseVertical

This app has a different approach for mouse control: you can point on the screen like your finger was a laser pointer.

# LeapStick

A joystick emulator where you can control 3 axes with the orientation of the hand plane.
